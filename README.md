# Subs Tracker

Subs Tracker is a subscription/trial/membership tracking web app. In the current era of web apps, SaaS, online entertainment and many more, any form of content, service and product is available online. That has also meant new and innovative ways that companies offer subscriptions and trials, from limited period discounted memberships, trials that end upon ending the auto-recurring payment or even unique trials period that end prematurely if there is no user activity or if a milestone isn't attained by user (JetBrains Academy trial period comes to mind - ends after a week if learner doesn't complete stage 1 of course).

Because of that, I decided to build an MVP CRUD-like web app that tracks such subscriptions so that you don't pay more that what is necessary and yet get the most value out of the subscription or trial. 

This is currently a work in progress, I have decided to use [Pentathlon XVIII](https://www.ultraworking.com/pentathlon?vgo_ee=XJUJ8%2FqygY3UcZbtRW8Y8r35hO7C%2FF3J%2FgQB9Uu3XAY%3D) as a self-imposed hackathon to build the first iteration of this.
